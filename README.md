# Statistical Modelling on Meteorites

This project explores whether meteorites falling near the equator exhibit statistically significant patterns in relation to:

- **Year of observed fall**
- **Mass**
- **Discovery type** (whether the meteorite was observed falling or found afterward)

Statistical modeling techniques were applied using the **R programming language** to analyze these relationships.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset provided by NASA, which contains over **45,000 meteorite observations**. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:
