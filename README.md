# ☄️ Statistical Modelling on Meteorites

This project investigates whether meteorites falling near the equator exhibit **statistically significant patterns** in relation to:

- 🗓️ **Year of observed fall**
- ⚖️ **Mass**
- 🔭 **Discovery type** — whether the meteorite was observed falling or found afterward

Statistical modeling techniques were applied using the **R programming language** to explore these relationships.

## 📊 Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset provided by **NASA**, containing over **45,000 meteorite observations**.  
You can access the publicly available dataset on Kaggle:

🔗 [NASA Meteorite Landings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings)

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent entries  
   - Filtered data by geographic region (focus on equatorial zones)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized spatial distributions  
   - Analyzed trends in mass, year, and discovery type

3. **Statistical Modelling**
   - Applied regression and correlation tests to identify significant relationships  
   - Evaluated whether proximity to the equator influences meteorite properties
